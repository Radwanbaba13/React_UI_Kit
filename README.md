# React UI Kit

## How I'm Working on This Project

This project is a work in progress, focusing on building a comprehensive UI kit using React. My approach includes:

- Iterative development with frequent updates.
- Emphasis on reusable components and widgets.
- Utilizing storybook for component documentation and visualization.

## How to Navigate This Project

- **.storybook**: Contains configuration and stories for the Storybook UI.
- **src Folder**: The main source code with React components.
- **public Folder**: Static assets and the entry HTML file.
- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Why I'm Building the Project This Way

I chose React for its component-based architecture, making it ideal for a UI kit. The use of Storybook aids in visualizing components during development. This project structure supports scalability and ease of use, catering to both my learning process and potential contributions from the community in the future.
